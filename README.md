# Weird Language System

## Project Description
The Weird Language System is a custom language interpreter in C++ designed for managing linked list operations. This system utilizes the Command design pattern for efficient instruction execution and features advanced object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These design choices ensure data management is flexible and modular, making the system robust and adaptable.

## Features
- **Custom Language Interpreter**: Executes commands for managing linked lists.
- **Command Design Pattern**: Enhances instruction handling efficiency.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implements encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure system robustness.

## File Structure
- `*.cpp` and `*.h`: C++ source and header files for system components.
- `Makefile`: Contains scripts to compile and link the project.
- `input.txt`: Sample input file demonstrating system usage.
- `OUTPUT.txt`: Output generated by the system based on `input.txt`.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## How to Compile and Run
1. **Compile the project**:
   ```bash
   make all
2. **Run the Executable**"  
   ```bash
   ./main
